This is a robot dog project made using a combination of arduino and javaScript which is controlled by voice and hand movements.
The arduino is connected via serial to the computer where the javaScript will run and the camera and mic will pick up the users
hand movements and words. Each word/gesture sends a signal to the arduino, which will react according to the signal that 
was sent.
And yeah thats basically the very basics on how it functions.
