OVERVIEW
This is a robot dog project made using a combination of arduino and javaScript which is controlled by voice and hand movements.
The arduino is connected via serial to the computer where the javaScript will run and the camera and mic will pick up the users
hand movements and words. Each word/gesture sends a signal to the arduino, which will react according to the signal that 
was sent.
And yeah thats basically the very basics on how it functions.

COMMENTS
If you look through the comments, they are really lengthy. 
This is because this project was part of a school assignment and I had to
explain every step in detail as part of my mark.

JAVASCRIPT CODE INFO
The javaScript code doesn't have the libraries imported traditionally
since I was using a web IDE called openProcessing. On openProcessing importing
libraries is just pressing a button on the side of the screen. I was using
it since that's the IDE my instructor taught the course in.
